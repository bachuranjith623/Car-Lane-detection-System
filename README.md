Lane detection is a critical aspect of self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles, crucial for understanding driving scenes. By identifying lane positions, vehicles gain guidance to stay within their lanes and avoid straying or entering other lanes, ensuring safe navigation.

This technology employs visual analysis of road images to detect lane markings, utilizing algorithms that encompass image processing, edge detection, and geometric analysis. Advanced techniques like machine learning and computer vision further improve accuracy, enabling systems to adapt to various road conditions and markings.

The display of detected lanes alongside original road images demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness. This comparison showcases how these systems accurately identify and highlight lanes across diverse driving environments.

Real-time integration of lane detection into advanced driver assistance systems enhances overall safety by providing warnings or corrective actions if a vehicle deviates from its lane, reducing the risk of accidents caused by unintended lane departures.
